        <p> HUMAN REASON, in one sphere of its cognition, is called upon to consider questions, which it cannot decline, as they are presented by its own nature, but which it cannot answer, as they transcend every faculty of the
        mind.It falls into this difficulty without any fault of its own. It begins with
        principles, which cannot be dispensed with in the field of experience, and
        the truth and sufficiency of which are, at the same time, insured by expe-
        rience. With these principles it rises, in obedience to the laws of its own
        nature, to ever higher and more remote conditions. But it quickly discov-
        The Critique of Pure Reason ersthat, in this way, its labours must remain ever incomplete, because new
        questions never cease to present themselves; and thus it finds itself com-
        pelled to have recourse to principles which transcend the region of experi-
        ence, while they are regarded by common sense without distrust. It thus
        falls into confusion and contradictions, from which it conjectures the pres-
        ence of latent errors, which, however, it is unable to discover, because the
        principles it employs, transcending the limits of experience, cannot be
        tested by that criterion. The arena of these endless contests is called
        Metaphysic.
        Time was, when she was the queen of all the sciences; and, if we take the
        will for the deed, she certainly deserves, so far as regards the high impor-
        tance of her object-matter, this title of honour. Now, it is the fashion of
        the time to heap contempt and scorn upon her; and the matron mourns,
        forlorn and forsaken, like Hecuba:
        Modo maxima rerum,
        Tot generis, natisque potens ...
        Nunc trahor exul, inops.
        â€” Ovid, Metamorphoses. xiii
        At first, her government, under the administration of the dogmatists, was
        an absolute despotism. But, as the legislative continued to show traces of the
        ancient barbaric rule, her empire gradually broke up, and intestine wars
        introduced the reign of anarchy; while the sceptics, like nomadic tribes,
        who hate a permanent habitation and settled mode of living, attacked from
        time to time those who had organized themselves into civil communities.
        But their number was, very happily, small; and thus they could not entirely
        put a stop to the exertions of those who persisted in raising new edifices,
        although on no settled or uniform plan.  </p>
